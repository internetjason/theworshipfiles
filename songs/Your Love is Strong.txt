Your Love is Strong

Jon Foreman

Key: B



I'm using shortened chord names, so here are the actual names and fingerings...

B = B5 (x-2-4-4-x-x)      |  C#m (x-4-6-6-5-x)

                                 

E = Esus2 (0-2-4-4-x-x)   |  B/D# (x-6-9-8-7-x)

                                  

G#m = G#m7 (4-x-4-4-x-x)  |  E (0-7-9-9-0-x)

                               

F#M (2-4-4-3-2-2)         |  F# = F#sus4 (x-9-11-11-0-x)

                                         



Verse 1:

B              E            G#m     E

Heavenly Father, you always amaze me

Let your kingdom come in my world and in my life

Give me the food I need to live through the day

And forgive me as I forgive the people that wrong me

G#m                 E      

Lead me far from temptation

G#m     E           B       E  G#m  E

Deliver me from the evil one        



Verse 2:

I look out the window, the birds are composing

Not a note is out of tune, or out of place

I walk to the meadow, and stare at the flowers

better dressed than any girl on her wedding day



So should I worry?

Why do I freak out?

          B          E          F#M        

God knows what I need, You know what I need



Chorus:

C#m           B/D#          E           F#     

Your love is, Your love is, Your love is strong



Verse 3:

The kingdom of the heavens is now advancing

Invade my heart, invade this broken town

The kingdom of the heavens is buried treasure

Will you sell yourself to buy the one you've found

Two things you told me

That you are strong and you love me

Yes, you love me



Ending:

C#m        B/D#             E            F#            

Our God in Heaven, hallowed be thy name above all names

Your kingdom come, your will be done

On earth as it is in heaven

Give us today our daily bread

Forgive us weary sinners

Keep us far away from our vices

and deliver us from these prisons
