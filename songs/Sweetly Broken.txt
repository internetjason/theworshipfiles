Intro:

G   Dsus    Em    C

                  



Verse 1:

               G                  Dsus   

To the cross I look, to the cross I cling

                    Em                         C    

Of it’s suffering I do drink, of it’s work I do sing

             G                        Dsus   

For on it my Savior, both bruised and crushed

                   Em              C   

Showed that God is love and God is just



Chorus:

G                         

At the cross You beckon me

Em                                     

You draw me gently to my knees and I am

D                                   

Lost for words, so lost in love, I’m

C                                 

Sweetly broken, wholly surrendered



Verse 2:

What a priceless gift, undeserved life

Have I been given through Christ crucified

You called me out of death, You call into life

And I was under Your wrath, now through the cross I reconcile



Chorus:

G                         

At the cross You beckon me

Em                                     

You draw me gently to my knees and I am

D                                   

Lost for words, so lost in love, I’m

C                                 

Sweetly broken, wholly surrendered



Bridge:

Am                            C   C/B

In awe of the cross I must confess

Am                              

How wondrous Your redeeming love

        C                     D   

And how great is Your faithfulness



Chorus:

G                         

At the cross You beckon me

Em                                     

You draw me gently to my knees and I am

D                                   

Lost for words, so lost in love, I’m

C                                 

Sweetly broken, wholly surrendered
