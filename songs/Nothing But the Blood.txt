Nothing But the Blood

Matt Redman

Key: A

Capo: 2



Verse 1:

G                          Em  

Your blood speaks a better word

                   G                           Em   

Than all the empty claims I've heard upon this earth

                         D 

Speaks righteousness for me

                   C    

And stands in my defense

                G     D  C

Jesus it's Your blood    



Chorus:

G                           

What can wash away our sins?

Em                           

What can make us whole again?

D                    

Nothing but the blood

C                        G     D  C

Nothing but the blood of Jesus    

What can wash us pure as snow?

Welcomed as the friends of God

Nothing but Your blood

Nothing but Your blood King Jesus



Verse 2:

Your cross testifies in grace

Tells of the Father's heart to make a way for us

Now boldly we approach

Not by earthly confidence

It's only Your blood.



Chorus:

G                           

What can wash away our sins?

Em                           

What can make us whole again?

D                    

Nothing but the blood

C                        G     D  C

Nothing but the blood of Jesus    

What can wash us pure as snow?

Welcomed as the friends of God

Nothing but Your blood

Nothing but Your blood King Jesus
