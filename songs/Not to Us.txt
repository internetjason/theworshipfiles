Not to Us

Chris Tomlin

Key: B



Verse 1:

B                               G#m 

The cross before me the world behind

                                 F#sus

No turning back raise the banner high

             E2              B   Bsus

It's not for me It's all for you 

B                                   G#m

Let the heavens shake and split the sky

                                    F#sus

Let the people clap their hands and cry

             E2               B   Bsus   B

It's not for us, it's all for you        



Chorus:

B         

Not to us,

            E   

but to your name

be the glory



Verse 2:

Our hearts unfold before your throne

the only place for those who know

It's not for us, it's all for you

send your holy fire on this offering

let our worship burn for the world to see

It's not for us, it's all for you



Bridge:

    B                                       

The earth is shaking, the mountains shouting

E               

It's all for you

    G#m                     F#sus        

The waves are crashing, the sun is raging

E               

It's all for you

    B                            

The universe spinning and singing

E               

It's all for you

     G#m7              F#sus           

Your children dancing, dancing, dancing

E                                 

It's all for you, It's all for you
