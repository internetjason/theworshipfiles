Find Me Here and speak To Me

I want to feel you, I need to hear you

C#m     B   A    C#m        B    A 

You are the light that's leading me

C#m B  A    C#m      B    A            C#m  B  A

Refrain:

E   B   A                 C#m         B  A            

How can I stand here with you and not be moved by you?

Would you tell me how could it be any better than this?



Verse 2:

You calm the storms, and you give me rest.

You hold me in your hands, you won't let me fall.

You steal my heart, and you take my breath away.

Would you take me in? Take me deeper now?

                   C#m                A   

Cause you're all I want, You're all I need

            E           B    

You're everything, everything

You're all I want your all I need

You're everything, everything.
