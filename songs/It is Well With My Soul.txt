It is Well With My Soul

Michael Bleecker

Key: E



Chorus:

E          E/G#      A 

It is well, it is well,

                   Bsus  B

It is well with my soul  



Verse 1:

A/C#              E/G#               A  

When peace like a river attendeth my way

                  Bsus        B   

When sorrows like sea billows roll

A/C#        E/G#                        A  

Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say

                   B   

It is well with my soul



Verse 2:

My sin oh, the bliss of this glorious thought

My sin not in part, but the whole

Is nailed to the cross and I bear it no more

Praise the Lord, O my soul



Verse 3:

And, Lord, haste the day when the faith shall be sight

The clouds be rolled back as a scroll

The trump shall resound and the Lord shall descend

Even so it is well with my soul



Ending:

      E           B    

It is well (It is well)

                     E     

With my soul (with my soul)

      A           Bsus B       E   

It is well, it is well with my soul
