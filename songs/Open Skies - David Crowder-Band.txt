Verse 1

Em           D             

Praise Him under open skies

C                   Cadd9        

Everything breathing praising God

In the company of all who love the King

I will dance, I will sing / It could be heavenly

Turn the music loud / Lift my voice and shout

From where I am / From where I've been

He's been there with me / He's built a monument

His very people / So let his people

Sing, sing, sing



Pre-Chorus

G/B         Cadd9    

And it's so wonderful

G/B             Cadd9

Just to be here now



Chorus

G            D             

Praise Him under open skies

Cadd9                            

Everything breathing praising God

In the company of all who love the King

Praise Him under open skies

Everything breathing praising God

In the company of all who love the King



Verse 2 (same as verse 1)

Praise Him under open skies / Everything breathing praising God

In the company of all who love the King

Let us dance, let us sing / It could be heavenly

Turn the music loud and sing



Bridge (G, D, Cadd9)

Lift your voice to heaven / Lift up your head and sing

To the One who gave his love / This is our offering

Lift your voice to heaven / Lift up your head and sing

To the One who gave His son / Here our lives we bring



Ending (G, D, Cadd9)

From wherever you are

Wherever you've been He's been there

So let his people sing



Refrain (G, D, Cadd9)

And it's so wonderful to be here now

Wherever you are wherever you've been

He's been there
