Pre-Chorus:

C                  G/B                    C    

The flowers of the field are crying to be heard

                 G/B    D          

The trees of the forest are singing

C          G/B                C    

All of the mountains with one voice

                G/B    D            

Are joining the chorus of this world

C  G/B  C  A

           



Chorus:

G      D            

I will not be silent

Em     C                   

I will not be quiet anymore



Bridge:

G                   D     

Running through the forest

              Em  

Dive into the lake

     C                    

Bare feet on beaches white

Standing in the canyon

Painted hills around

The wind against my skin



Every ocean, every sea

Every river, every stream

Every mountain, every tree

Every blade of grass will sing



Ending:

       G      D            Em   C            

Make a joyful noise to the Lord all the earth
