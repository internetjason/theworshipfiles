No Not One

Brandon Heath

Key: G



Verse 1:

G                             C   

No better word than from your lips

                              Am   

No perfect life than what you lived

                        G  

No greater gift, no not one



Verse 2:

No brighter star has ever shined

No better hope for all mankind

No higher mind, no not one



Pre-Chorus:

C                    

No one has ever known

Am                            

This kind of love youâ€™ve shown



Chorus:

          C                    G   

There has never been a greater love

          Em           D  

Than your son; no, not one

               C                  G   

And there will never be a greater love

        D  

No, not one

With his life you have forgiven us

Hope has come, hope has come

And there will never be a greater love

No, not one



Verse 3:

No image true or sweeter frame

No simple word can match your name

No greater fame

No, not one



Pre-Chorus 2:

No one has ever seen

The depth of your majesty



Bridge:

C          G   

No greater call

Em          D                   

You gave us all a reason to live

No greater love

You gave us all a reason to give

No greater life

You gave us all a reason to shine

No greater love

Forever mine
