Key: F



Verse 1:

F                                                  

Give me a second I, I need to get my story straight

   Dm                                                              

My friends are in the bathroom getting higher than the empire state

   Gm                                            

my lover she's waiting for me just across the bar

              Bb                       C                  

My seats been taken by some sunglasses asking 'bout a scar

F                                     

and I know I gave it to you months ago

Dm                                 Gm                                  

I know you're trying to forget but between the drinks and subtle things

                              Bb                             C    

the holes in my apologies you know I'm trying hard to take it back

C             Gm      Am                  Dm        C       Bb 

so if by the time the bar closes and you feel like falling down

Bb             C   

I'll carry you home



Chorus:

F               Dm                             

Tonight We are  young So let's set the world on

Bb                                  F  C

fire We can burn brigh-ter than the sun

F               Dm                             

Tonight We are  young So let's set the world on

Verse 2:

      F                                 

Now I know that I'm not all that you got

I guess that I I just thought maybe we could find a ways to fall apart

Gm                                         Bb 

But our friends in back So let's raise the tab

                         C            

Cause I found someone to carry me home

F                         Dm                           F

The moon is on my side       I have no reason to run   

                          C                   

So will someone come and carry me home tonight

F                           Dm                             F

The angels never arrived       but I can hear the choir

and you feel like falling down
