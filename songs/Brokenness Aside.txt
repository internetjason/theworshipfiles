Brokenness Aside

All Sons & Daughters

Key: C



Verse 1:

           C    Dm   Am

Will your grace run out

      C   Dm   Am

If I let you down

        C  Dm  Am

‘Cause all I know

          Fmaj7 G

Is how to run   



Chorus:

F              C    

‘Cause I am a sinner

If its not one thing its another

F             C   

Caught up in words

            G  

Tangled in lies

F              C  

You are the Savior

               G         Am  

And you take brokenness aside

              F    C 

And make it beautiful

     G   

Beautiful



Verse 2:

Will you call me child

When I tell you lies 

Cause all I know 

Is how to cry 



Bridge: 

Dm            Am     

You make it beautiful

C            G    Dm  Am  G

You make it beautiful
