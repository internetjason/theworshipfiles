To Know Your Name

Hillsong United

Key: C



Verse 1:

Am                    F              C    

The precious blood of Jesus Christ redeems

             G                   Am  

Forgiven I'm alive, restored set free

               F               C 

Your majesty resides inside of me

            G                   Am  

Forever I believe, forever I believe



Verse 2:

Am               F                  C   

Arrested by your truth and righteousness

                   G                Am  

Your grace has overwhelmed my brokenness

                  F                   C   

Convicted by your spirit, led by your word

                     G   

Your love will never fail

                     F   

Your love will never fail



Chorus:

        C        G         Am              F            

Cause I know you gave, the world your only son for us to

C         G        Am              F            

Know your name, to live within the savior's love

       C       G      Am              F        

And he took my place, knowing he'd be crucified

        C          G        Am       F         

And you loved, you loved, a people undeserving!
