Verse 1:

Em      C          G         D    

Amazing grace, how sweet the sound

     Em      C           G  D

That saved a wretch like me 

  Em       C        G       D    

I once was lost but now I'm found

    Em        C     G      D      

Was blind but now I see so clearly



Chorus:

Em   C                 G          D         

Hallelujah, grace like rain falls down on me

Em   C             G                 D             Em 

Hallelujah, all my stains are washed away, washed away



Verse 2:

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear 

And grace my fears relieved 

How precious did that grace appear 

The hour I first believed

Verse 3:

When we've been there ten thousand years 

Bright shining as the sun 

We've no less days to sing Your praise 

Than when we first begun
