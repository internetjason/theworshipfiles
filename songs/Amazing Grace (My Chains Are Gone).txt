Amazing Grace (My Chains Are Gone)

Chris Tomlin

Key: G



Chorus:

              C                  G    

My chains are gone, I've been set free

          C                   G  

My God, My Savior has ransomed me

          C               Em     

And like a flood his mercy reigns

         D              G    

Un-ending love, amazing grace



Verse 1:

G                 C         G    

Amazing grace how sweet the sound

     G                   D 

That saved a wretch like me

  G                  C       G    

I once was lost, but now I'm found

    G         D     G  

Was blind but now I see



Verse 2:

T'was grace that taught my heart to fear

And grace my fears relieved

How precious did that grace appear

The hour I first believed



Chorus:

              C                  G    

My chains are gone, I've been set free

          C                   G  

My God, My Savior has ransomed me

          C               Em     

And like a flood his mercy reigns

         D              G    

Un-ending love, amazing grace



Verse 3:

Through many dangers, toils and snares

we have already come

T'was Grace that brought us safe thus far

and Grace will lead us home



Chorus:

              C                  G    

My chains are gone, I've been set free

          C                   G  

My God, My Savior has ransomed me

          C               Em     

And like a flood his mercy reigns

         D              G    

Un-ending love, amazing grace
