Overwhelm Me

Michael Bleecker

Key: E



Verse 1:

E                          B 

Take not thy presence from me

        A                Am  

For I desire to know you more

E                     B  

For you are worthy of all

                 A            Am  

You’re worthy of all I am and more



Pre-Chorus:

A                B                   

I need to set my mind on things above

A                         C#m   B  

On the holiness and glory of my God

A                  B          

In the heavens and in my heart

A                     

Who created a mountain

        C#m              B           A    

And who set a spark that grew into a flame

Am                       

That burns deeply for you



Chorus:

E   B         A                          

Overwhelm me, take me from this place and

Am                               

Put me in the place where You are

E   B         A                          

Overwhelm me, shake the ground I stand on

Am                        C#m   B   A  Am

I want to be dependent on you…
