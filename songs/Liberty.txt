Intro:

Em





Verse 1:

    Em          C     

The Lord is the Spirit

          D                         

Where the Spirit of the Lord is, now

         Gsus4 G

There is liberty

And the Spirit lives inside of me

Where the Spirit of the Lord is, now

There is liberty, there is liberty, 

There is liberty



Chorus:

    C                  G Gsus4 G

For freedom You set me free    

    C                G Gsus4 G

And yes, I am free indeed    

    Em             

You rewrote my name

    C                

And shackled my shame

    Am                D  

You opened my eyes to see

     Em  

I am free



Verse 2:

When the spirit of the world

Comes to kill me and enslave me I will say 

There is liberty

For the chains of sin that once entangled me

Have been broken, now I'm singing 'cause I'm free

There is liberty, there is liberty, 

There is liberty



Bridge:

Em  C  D

       

Em                 

The storm rolled in

                   C   

It was dark in the land

             D   

As the Son of Man

         Em  

Was crucified

You don't take his life

He laid it down

He paid the price

And shed His blood



Ending:

It is done!

The veil is torn

He has won

And I am free

And I am free

And I am free

I am free
