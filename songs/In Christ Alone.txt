Verse 1:

E                          B    

In Christ alone my hope is found

         A         B            E   

He is my light, my strength, my song

           E                 B     

This Cornerstone, this solid ground

                 A        B           E    

Firm through the fiercest drought and storm



               A                    B     

What heights of love, what depths of peace

              A                       B     

When fears are stilled, when strivings cease

         E             B   

My Comforter, my All in All

            A             B  E    

Here in the love of Christ I stand



Verse 2:

In Christ alone, who took on flesh

Fullness of God in helpless babe

This gift of love and righteousness

Scorned by the ones He came to save



'Til on that cross as Jesus died

The wrath of God was satisfied

For every sin on Him was laid

Here in the death of Christ I live



Verse 3:

There in the ground His body lay

Light of the world by darkness slain

Then bursting forth in glorious Day

Up from the grave he rose again



And as He stands in victory

Sin's curse has lost its grip on me

For I am His and He is mine

Bought with the precious blood of Christ



Verse 4:

No guilt of life, no fear in death

This is the power of Christ in me

From life's first cry to final breath

Jesus commands my destiny



No power of hell, no scheme of man

Can ever pluck me from His hand

'Til He returns or calls me home

Here in the power of Christ I'll stand



Ending:

E                 

I find my strength

A             

I find my hope

C#m           

I find my help

A              

In Christ alone



When fear assails

When darkness falls

I find my peace

in Christ alone



E             

I give my life

F#m          

I give my all

E/G#            

I sing this song

A              

To Christ alone



The King of kings

The Lord of all

All heaven sings

To Christ alone
