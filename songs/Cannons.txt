Intro:

G  C  Em  Am

          



Verse 1:

     G                D     

It’s falling from the clouds

  Am                 Em   

A strange and lovely sound

  C              G           D   

I hear it in the thunder and rain

     G              D    

It’s ringing in the skies

     Am             Em   

Like cannons in the night

    C                G        D

The music of the universe plays



Chorus:

G                 C           

You are holy, great and mighty

    Em                       D            

The moon and the stars declare who You are

    G                    C            

I’m so unworthy, but still You love me

   Em                 D                     G  

Forever my heart will sing of how great You are



Verse 2:

Beautiful and free

The song of galaxies

It’s reaching far beyond the Milky Way

Lets join in with the sound

C’mon let’s sing it loud

As the music of the universe plays



Bridge:

    C                          Em          D

All glory, honor, power is Yours (Amen)    

    C                          Em      D

All glory, honor, power is Yours (Amen)

    Am                         Em              D

All glory, honor, power is Yours forever, Amen
