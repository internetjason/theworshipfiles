Come Thou Fount (new)

Robert Robinson

Key: D



Verse 1:

D                         A       

Come, Thou fount of every blessing

        G                  D    

Tune my heart to sing Your grace

           D            A      

Streams of mercy, never ceasing

         G                D     

Call for songs of loudest praise

         D                    

Teach me some melodious sonnet

Sung by flaming tongues above

           D               A      

Praise His name, I'm fixed upon it

        G               D   

Name of God's redeeming love



Verse 2:

All my life Your love has blessed me

You have drawn me to this place

And I know Your hand will lead me

Safely home by Your good grace

Jesus sought me when a stranger

Wandering from the fold of God

He, to rescue me from danger

Bought me with His precious blood



Verse 3:

Oh to grace how great a debtor 

Daily I'm constrained to be

Let your goodness hold me nearer 

Bind my wandering heart to Thee

Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it 

Prone to leave the God I love

Here's my heart, O take and seal it 

Seal it for Your purpose, Lord



Verse 4:

Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it 

Prone to leave the God I love

Here's my heart, O take and seal it 

Seal it for Your purpose, Lord

Here's my heart, O take and seal it 

Seal it for Your purpose, Lord
