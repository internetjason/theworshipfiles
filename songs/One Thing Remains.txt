Verse 1:

         F               C               G    

And it’s higher than the mountains that I face

         F                 C         G       

And it’s stronger than the power of the grave

     F               C          G        

It’s constant in the trial and the change

         F  C    G    

This one thing remains



Verse 2:

    F             C           G    

And on and on and on and on it goes

   F              C           G    

It overwhelms and satisfies my soul

      F          C          G     

And I never ever have to be afraid

         F  C    G    

This one thing remains



Chorus:

     Am              

Your love never fails

   F             

It never gives up

C                 G 

Never runs out on me



Bridge:

   F         C   

In death, in life

    G             Dm        

I’m confident and covered by

    F        C         G    

The power of your great love

   F       C   

My debt is paid

        G                Dm      

There’s nothing that can separate

   F          C          G   

My heart from your great love
