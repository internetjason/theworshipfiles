Every E* in the verses is actually an E7sus4, as Emaj would not fit in the key and would not sound good.

Verse 1:

E*   C  G             D   

Take me far away from here

E*   C            G        D   

Save me from this world of fear

E*    C           G                D   

Break me from the things I hold so near

           C        D  

They’re so far from You



Verse 2:

E*     C              G          D 

Reveal to me what You want me to do

    E*    C             G             D 

And place me where Your will draws me to

     E* C                G         D        C  

Lord be pleased with the worship I bring to You

          D                  

I sing to You, I shout to You



Chorus:

G          C                  Em             D/F# 

Here I am, send me out let me shine for Your glory

G            C                    Em         D/F#

I will read, I’ll live out and proclaim Your Word

Em           D/F#        G         C            Em

Take me now, show me how I need to live not for me

        C            D     E*

But for You and Your glory
