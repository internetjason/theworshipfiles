I Need You

Jars of Clay

Key: E



Intro: 

E  C#m

   



Verse 1:

E                C#m  

Strangely out of place

E                             C#m       

There is a light filling this room where

                       A

None would follow before



                            E     

I can't deny it burns me up inside

                                  A   

I fan the flames to melt away my pride



Do I want shelter from the rain

      E                    

Or the rain to wash me away





Chorus:

B                         F#m     

I need You, I need You, I need You

B                         C#m     

I need You, I need You, I need You

A                     E  

You're all I'm living for



Verse 2:

E                    C#m 

I might sound like a fool

E                      C#m                

But I think I felt You moving closer to me



A                                    E  

Face to the ground to hide the fatal cut

                                       A 

I fight the weight, I feel You lift me up



You are the shelter from the rain

        E                   

And the rain to wash me away



Chorus 2:

B                         F#m     

I need You, I need You, I need You

B                         F#m     

I need You, I need You, I need You

(You're all I'm living for)

B                         C#m     

I need You, I need You, I need You

   A                  B  

You're all I'm living for

(all I'm living for)

               C#m

All I'm living for

(all I'm living for)

       A              E  

You're all I'm living for



Bridge:

A                                    E  

Face to the ground to hide the fatal cut



I fight the weight, I feel You lift me up

A                            E    

I can't deny it burns me up inside

                                 A    

I fan the flames to melt away my pride



Only have a second to spare

        E                                    A

All the time in the world to know You're there



You are the shelter from the rain

        E                   

And the rain to wash me away
