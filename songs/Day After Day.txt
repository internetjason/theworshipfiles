Verse 1:

B                                E       

At times I try to rule the world You made

            G#m                              F#  

You show me power is Yours alone to give and take

  B                                  E  

A day will come when every knee will bow

          G#m                

And every tongue confess that

                  E          F#  

You are Lord both now and forever



Chorus:

B                        G#m     

Day after day our God is reigning

           F#/A#      E                  

He's never shaken, my hope is in the Lord

B                          G#m     

Time after time our God is faithful

            F#/A#      E                  

Trustworthy Savior, my hope is in the Lord



Verse 2:

B                                     E   

The fear of man and what we plan will fade

             G#m                        F# 

I'm reminded You alone are God of every day

B                                   E   

Like the flowers, man will rise and fall

            G#m        

But You are everlasting

             E    F#    

Never ending God eternal

E                          F#/A#

Let the songs of adoration rise

                          G#m 

Our God is reigning up on high

                      B                        

He's worthy to receive the praise and the glory
