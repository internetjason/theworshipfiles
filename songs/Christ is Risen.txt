Christ is Risen

Matt Maher and Mia Fieldes

Key: E



Verse 1:

    E                          

Let no one caught in sin remain

  A                           

Inside the lie of inward shame

    E                          

But fix our eyes upon the cross

    A              C#m          B   

And run to Him who showed great love

    E    A   B 

And bled for us

              E    A   B 

Freely You've bled for us



Chorus:

          E                  

Christ is risen from the dead

          E/G#               

Trampling over death by death

      A               

Come awake, come awake

         C#m              B    

Come and rise up from the grave

          E                  

Christ is risen from the dead

       E/G#              

We are one with Him again

      A               

Come awake, come awake

         C#m              B    

Come and rise up from the grave



Verse 2:

  E                              

Beneath the weight of all our sin

    A                              

You bowed to none but heaven's will

   E                                 

No scheme of hell, no scoffer's crown

   A                C#m      B   

No burden great can hold You down

   E        A   B    

In strength You reign

                 E      A  B    

Forever let Your church proclaim

Trampling over death by death

      A               

Come awake, come awake

Come and rise up from the grave

          E                  

Christ is risen from the dead

       E/G#              

We are one with Him again

      A               

Come awake, come awake

Come and rise up from the grave



Bridge:

E A      C#m           B     

O death, where is your sting?

O hell, where is your victory?

E A            C#m          B    

O church, come stand in the light

    E        A         C#m        B             

The glory of God has defeated the night. Singing

E A      C#m           B     

O death, where is your sting?

Come awake, come awake

         C#m              B    

Come and rise up from the grave
