Verse 1:

C#m     A                 C#m    

Life is full of light and shadows

       A              C#m   A        C#m   A

Oh the joy and oh the sorrow, oh the sorrow



Pre-Chorus:

C#m             A              C#m  

And yet will He bring day from night

                A             B    

And yet will He bring dark to light



Chorus:

     E               A 

When shadows fall on us

            E   

We will not fear

          B     

We will remember

     C#m               A 

When darkness falls on us

            E   

We will not fear

          B     

We will remember

     C#m           

When all seems lost

           A                      

When we're thrown and weâ€™re tossed

        E              

We'll remember the cost

      B                            C#m  

We're resting in the shadow of the cross
