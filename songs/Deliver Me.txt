Deliver Me

David Crowder

Key: E



Verse 1:

C#m       B           A      E  Emaj7

Deliver me out of the sadness   

Deliver me from all the madness

Deliver me courage to guide me

Deliver me Your strength inside me



Chorus:

C#m       E   

All of my life

             B     

I've been in hiding

F#11                                   

Wishing there was someone just like You

Now that You're here

Now that I've found You

I know that You're the One to pull me through



Verse 2:

Deliver me loving and caring

Deliver me giving and sharing

Deliver me this cross that I'm bearing



Bridge:

C#m          B              

Jesus, Jesus how I trust You

A                   E          Emaj7

How I've proved You o'er and o'er

C#m          B        A     E  Emaj7

Jesus, Jesus precious Jesus
