Jingle Bells

Christmas

Key: G



Verse 1:

G                       

Dashing through the snow

     C                    

In a one horse open sleigh

Em                   

O'er the fields we go

C                   

Laughing all the way

G                      

Bells on bob tails ring

C                    

Making spirits bright

     Em           D             

What fun it is to laugh and sing

  C                     

A sleighing song tonight



Chorus:

    G                         

Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells

Jingle all the way

Oh, what fun it is to ride

In a one horse open sleigh

Jingle bells, jingle bells

Jingle all the way

Oh, what fun it is to ride

In a one horse open sleigh



Verse 2:

A day or two ago

I thought I'd take a ride

And soon Miss Fanny Bright

Was seated by my side

The horse was lean and lank

Misfortune seemed his lot

We got into a drifted bank

And then we got upset
