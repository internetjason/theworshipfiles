Verse 1:

        G                 

You are good, You are good

When there's nothing good in me

        D/F#              

You are love, You are love

On display for all to see

        G                   

You are light, You are light

When the darkness closes in

        D/F#              

You are hope, You are hope

                           G

You have covered all my sin



Verse 2:

You are peace, You are peace

When my fear is crippling

You are true, You are true

Even in my wandering

You are joy, You are joy

You're the reason that I sing

You are life, You are life,

In You death has lost it's sting



Chorus:

G                       D/G  

Oh, I’m running to Your arms,

                    Em  

I’m running to Your arms

                   D/E 

The riches of Your love

     D          C    

Will always be enough

           Em       D      C    

Nothing compares to Your embrace

             Em        D    G    

Light of the world, forever reign



Verse 3:

You are more, You are more

Than my words will ever say

You are Lord, You are Lord

All creation will proclaim

You are here, You are here

In your presence I'm made whole

You are God, You are God

Of all else I'm letting go

Em                  

 My heart will sing,

C             

 No other name

G      D     

 Jesus  Jesus
