A refuge for the poor

This is our God



He will wipe away your tears

And return your wasted years

This is our God

A healer to the broken

And comfort in our sadness

This is our God

A fountain for the thirsty

A lover for the lonely

This is our God



He brings glory to the humble

And crowns for the faithful

This is our God
