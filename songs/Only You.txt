Only You

David Crowder

Key: C



Verse 1:

C       G/B             Am  

Take my heart, I lay it down

       F                 C      

At the feet of you who's crowned

        G/B               Am

Take my life, I’m letting go

          F               C      

I lift it up to you who’s throned



Chorus:

And I will worship you, Lord

Only you, Lord

And I will bow down before You

Only You Lord 



Verse 2:

Take my fret, take my fear

All I have, I’m leaving here

Be all my hopes, be all my dreams

Be all my delights, be my everything 



Bridge:

And it’s just you and me here now

Only you and me here now
