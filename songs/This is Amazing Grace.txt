Verse 1:

G                                         

  Who breaks the power of sin and darkness

C                                          

  Whose love is mighty and so much stronger

Em                 D                         C

  The King of Glory,  the King above all kings

G                                             

  Who shakes the whole earth with holy thunder

C                                           

  Who leaves us breathless in awe and wonder

Em                 D                         C

  The King of Glory,  the King above all kings



Chorus:

                  G  

This is amazing grace

                   C  

This is unfailing love

                         Em 

That You would take my place

                         D  

That You would bear my cross

                         G  

You would lay down Your life

                      C 

That I would be set free

Em                   

Oh, Jesus, I sing for

D                                G   C

   All that You've done for me       



Verse 2:

G                                     

  Who brings our chaos back into order

C                                        

  Who makes the orphan a son and daughter

Em                D                    

  The King of Glory,  the King of glory

G                                             

  Who rules the nations with truth and justice

C                                             

  Shines like the sun in all of its brilliance

Em                  D                         C

  The King of Glory,  the King above all kings



Bridge:

G                               

Worthy is the Lamb who was slain

C                                         

Worthy is the King who conquered the grave

Em                              

Worthy is the Lamb who was slain

C                                         

Worthy is the King who conquered the grave
