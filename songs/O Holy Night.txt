Key: C



Verse 1:

Cmaj7             F                  Cmaj7  

O holy night, the stars are brightly shining

          Em           F    G        Cmaj7

It is the night of our dear Savior’s birth

                      F             Cmaj7 

Long lay the world in sin and error pining

          Em             F    G        Cmaj7

‘Til He appeared and the soul felt its worth



Pre-Chorus 1:

  G            Gsus   C                   

A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices

    G         Gsus  C                    

For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn



Chorus:

Am           Em-Em7-Em9 Dm            Am    

Fall on your knees, oh hear the angel voices

  C G/B   Am-G    F    G                Cmaj7

O night divine, O night when Christ was born



  G       Am-G    F     G            Cmaj7

O night divine, O night, O night divine



Verse 2:

Truly He taught us to love one another 

His law is love and His gospel is peace 

Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother 

And in His name all oppression shall cease 



Pre-Chorus 2:

Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we 

Let all within us praise His holy name
