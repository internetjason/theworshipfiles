Verse 1:

    C                   Am                

The splendor of a King, clothed in majesty

                    F    

Let all the earth rejoice

All the earth rejoice



He wraps himself in Light, and darkness tries to hide

And trembles at His voice

Trembles at His voice



Chorus:

    C                             

How great is our God, sing with me

How great, how great is our God

Age to age He stands

And time is in His hands

Beginning and the end

Beginning and the end



The Godhead Three in One

Father Spirit Son

The Lion and the Lamb

The Lion and the Lamb
