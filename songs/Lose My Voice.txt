Lose My Voice

The Stillpoint Band

Key: E



Verse 1:

       E                

When I speak you hear me

B               C#m           

Even though you knew each word

A                 B     

Before it left my tongue

       E               

When I sing you hear me

B                 C#m            

Even though these rocks would cry

   A                B   

If this song went unsung



Chorus:

        E             B            

I wanna shout as if I had no choice

        C#m                A            

Til I’m out of breath or I lose my voice

    E  B                 C#m   A

I believe that you’re my king  



Verse 2:

When I cry each tear frees 

Even this heart of mine 

To recognize you’re the one 



Then every word you speak frees 

Even me to walk this life 

Hand in hand with the son 



Chorus 2:

I'm gonna shout it from the mountaintops 

Until like a storm who's every drop will sing 

You're my king 

I will sing 

You're my king 

You're my king, you're everything



Ending:

I’m gonna jump until my legs give out 

And with all creation scream and shout 

I believe that you’re my king
