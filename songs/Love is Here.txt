Verse 1:

Em          G/B    C             

Come to the Water, you who thirst

           Em            G/B    C

And you'll thirst no more       

Come to the Father, you who work

And you'll work no more



Pre-Chorus:

D               Em       C   

And all you who labor in vain

And to the broken and shamed



Chorus:

        G             C  

Love is here, Love is now

        Em               D               C   

Love is pouring from His hands, from his brow

        G             C   

Love is near, it satisfies

Em               D                C   

Streams of mercy flowing from His side

              Em   G  C

Cause love is here    



Verse 2:

Come to the treasure, you who search

And you'll search no more

Come to the lover you who want

And you'll want no more



Bridge:

C                             

And to the bruised and fallen,

G/B                               

Captive, bound, and broken hearted

Am            

He is the Lord

D                   

He is the Lord, yeah

C                                  

By His stripes He's paid all ransom

G/B                               

From His wounds we drink salvation

Am            

He is the Lord

D             

He is the Lord
