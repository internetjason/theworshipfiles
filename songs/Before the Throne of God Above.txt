Verse 1:

           E         A    E   

Before the throne of God above

                            G#m 

I have a strong and perfect plea

             A      E     B       C#m 

A great high Priest whose name is Love

         A                B   E 

Who ever lives and pleads for me

           A             E   

My name is graven on His hand

           A              C#m  

My name is written on His heart

            A        B         C#m   

I know that while in heaven He stands

              A             B C#m 

No tongue can bid me thence depart

              A             B E   

No tongue can bid me thence depart



Verse 2:

           E         A     E   

When Satan tempts me to despair

                              G#m

And tells me of the guilt within

         A    E   B       C#m  

Upward I look and see Him there

            A          B  E  

Who made an end to all my sin

          A              E   

Because a sinless Savior died

          A               C#m 

My sinful soul is counted free

            A       B    C#m 

For God the Just is satisfied

           A          B   C#m

To look on Him and pardon me

           A          B   E 

To look on Him and pardon me



Chorus:

     B           G#m C#m

Hallelujah, hallelujah

           A          B      E  

Praise the One, Risen Son of God

Behold Him there, the risen Lamb

My perfect spotless righteousness

            A   E  B     C#m

The great unchangeable I Am

            A         B  E    

The King of Glory and of grace

          A              E  

One in Himself, I cannot die

           A                C#m  

My soul is purchased by His blood

           A        B         C#m 

My life is hid with Christ on high

               A          B  C#m

With Christ my Savior and my God

               A          B  E  

With Christ my Savior and my God
