Buried in the Grave

All Sons & Daughters

Key: E



Verse 1:

E                                 

There was a day we held our breath

    B                             

And felt the sting of bitter death

     A                                E    

When all our hopes were buried in the grave



E                                   

Our eyes awake, our hearts were torn

  B                               

Between our faith and what we knew

  A                                E   

Before our King was buried in the grave



Pre-Chorus:

    C#m                     

And grace was in the tension

    B                   

Of everything we've lost

A                    

Standing empty handed

B                     

Shattered by the cross



Chorus:

       E/G#           

All we had, all we had

      A              E     

Was a promise like a thread

        E/G#          

Holding us, keeping us

        A              E   

Oh from fraying at the edge



       E/G#             

All we knew, all we knew

        C#m        B    A    

Was You said You'd come again

      E       B        E   

You'd rise up from the dead



Verse 2:

There was a day we looked for proof 

That you had risen from the tomb 

And all our doubts began to roll away 



We touched the scars upon your hands 

You kept Your word, oh Son of Man 

You buried death by taking on the grave 



Pre-Chorus 2:

You came here to save us 

'Cause everything was lost 

No longer empty handed 

Clinging to the cross 



Bridge:

     C#m        E       

It is won, it is done...



Ending:

       G#m                

What we have, what we have

      A              E    

Is a promise like a thread

        G#m           

Holding us, keeping us

        A              E   

Oh from fraying at the edge



       G#m                

What we know, what we know

        C#m        B    A   

Is You said You'd come again

    E       B        C#m 

You rose up from the dead

    E       B        E   

You rose up from the dead
