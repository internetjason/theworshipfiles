Beautiful

Phil Wickham

Key: D



Verse 1:

D                  G            

I see Your face in every sunrise

    Bm                        A               

The colors of the morning are inside Your eyes

The world awakens in the light of the day

I look up to the sky and say

You’re beautiful



Verse 2:

I see Your power in the moonlit night

Where planets are in motion and galaxies are bright

We are amazed in the light of the stars

It’s all proclaiming who You are

You’re beautiful, You're beautiful



Verse 3:

I see you there hanging on a tree

You bled and then you died and then you rose again for me

Now you are sitting on Your heavenly throne

Soon we will be coming home

You’re beautiful, you're beautiful



Verse 4:

When we arrive at eternity’s shore

Where death is just a memory and tears are no more

We’ll enter in as the wedding bells ring

Your bride will come together and we’ll sing

You’re beautiful, You're beautiful, You're beautiful



Ending:

I see Your face, You're beautiful, You're beautiful, You're beautiful
