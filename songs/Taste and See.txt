Taste and See

The Stillpoint Band

Key: G

82 BPM



Verse:

G             D/F#

Less like the moon

            C   

More like a bulb

                  D          

Whose light comes from within

G             D/F#             C 

The light you see is Christ in me

             D         

And where it must begin



From within He imparts

Who He is to your heart



Taste and see

Taste and see

Taste and see



Instrumental:

Em  C  G  D/F#

          



Chorus:

Em                 C           

Taste and see love overwhelming

G             D/F#         

Never ending, never failing
