From wherever spring arrives to heal the ground

From where ever searching comes to look itself

A trace of what we're looking for

so be quiet now, and wait



D      C   D         C

The ocean is growing 

D           C        

The tide is coming in

Here it is



            G   

Here is our King

            G/B 

Here is our Love

            C                                  G  

Here is our God who's come to bring us back to him

          G/B 

He is the one,

      C    

He is Jesus



And what was said to the rose to make it unfold

Was said to me, here in my chest

So be quiet now, and rest.



Em  D/F#  G

Majesty!  

Am  G/B   C

Finally!
