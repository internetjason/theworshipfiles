Sing to the King

Billy Foote

Key: D

54 BPM



Verse 1:

D                                      

Sing to the King Who is coming to reign

Glory to Jesus, the Lamb that was slain

Life and salvation His empire shall bring

And joy to the nations when Jesus is King



Chorus:

D                       

Come, let us sing a song

  Em                               G    

A song declaring that we belong to Jesus

             D    C

He is all we need 

D                        

Lift up a heart of praise

Em                             G    

Sing now with voices raised to Jesus

           D    

Sing to the King



Verse 2:

D                                     

For His returning we watch and we pray

We will be ready the dawn of that day

We'll join in singing with all the redeemed

'Cause Satan is vanquished and my Jesus is King
