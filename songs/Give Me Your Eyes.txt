Verse 1:

Em                             

  Looked down from a broken sky

C                              

  Traced out by the city lights

G                          

  My world from a mile high

D                               

  Best seat in the house tonight

Em                                  

  Touched down on the cold black top

C                            

  Hold on for the sudden stop

G                             

  Breath in the familiar shock

D                       

  Of confusion and chaos

Em                 C              

  All those people going somewhere

G            D         

Why have I never cared?



Chorus:

             Em                      

Give me your eyes for just one second

             C                

Give me your eyes so I can see

     G                        

Everything that I keep missing

             D                

Give me your love for humanity

             Em                         

Give me your arms for the broken hearted

                  C                  

The ones that are far beyond my reach

             G                           

Give me your heart for the once forgotten

             D                

Give me your eyes so I can see



Verse 2:

Step out on a busy street

See a girl and our eyes meet

Does her best to smile at me

To hide whats underneath

Theres a man just to her right

Black suit and a bright red tie

Too ashamed to tell his wife

He's out of work

He's buying time

All those people going somewhere

Why have I never cared?



Bridge:

Em                               

  I've Been there a million times

C                         

  A couple of million eyes

G                       

  Just moving past me by

  D                                     

I swear I never thought that I was wrong

Em                           

  Well I want a second glance

C                           

  So give me a second chance

G                       

  To see the way you see

    D               

The people all alone
