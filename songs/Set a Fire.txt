G                     

No Place I'd rather be

C                     

No Place I'd rather be

Em                    

No place I'd rather be

Here in your Love, Here in your love



Chorus:

G                      C  

Set a Fire Down in my Soul

                                 Em    

That I cant contain that I cant control

                      C

I want more of you God

I want more of you God
