Verse 1:

        G          C     G   

In your ocean, I’m ankle deep

           G              C     G   

I feel the waves crashin’ on my feet

            G            C       Em

It’s like I know where I need to be

           D                        C          

But I can’t figure out, yeah I can’t figure out



              G          C       G      

Just how much air I will need to breathe

          G           C    G 

When your tide rushes over me

             G          C      Em 

There’s only one way to figure out

        D                      C            

Will you let me drown, will you let me drown



Chorus 1:

G                     C   

Hey now, this is my desire

                  Em  

Consume me like a fire

             D                       

Cause I just want something beautiful

   G                         C       

To touch me, I know that I’m in reach

Em                         

Cause I am down on my knees

            D                      

I’m waiting for something beautiful



G      C      Em    D                     G

Oh oh, Oh oh, oh-oh-oh something beautiful



Verse 2:

And the water is risin’ quick

And for years I was scared of it

We can’t be sure when it will subside

So I won’t leave your side, no I can’t leave your side



Bridge:

G    C  G                      C    G   

In a daydream, I couldn’t live like this

G                       D                        

I wouldn’t stop until I found something beautiful

G      C    G             C       G   

When I wake up, And all I want, I have

G                         D                       

You know it’s still all I need something beautiful
