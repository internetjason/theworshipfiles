Indescribable

Chris Tomlin

Key: G



Verse 1:

Em                                               Dsus/F#  G

From the highest of heights to the depths of the sea      

Am                        Am7/G   F

Creation's revealing Your majesty 

Em                                          Dsus/F#  G

From the colors of fall to the fragrance of spring   

Am                                       Am7/G 

Every creature unique in the song that it sings

F   C2        

All exclaiming



Chorus: 

G              Dsus          

Indescribable, uncontainable,

C2                                                   Em   

You placed the stars in the sky and You know them by name.

Dsus/F#        C2  

You are amazing God

G             Dsus       

All powerful, untameable,

C2                                          Em      

Awestruck we fall to our knees as we humbly proclaim

Dsus/F#         C2 

You are amazing God



Verse 2:

Who has told every lightning bolt where it should go

Or seen heavenly storehouses laden with snow

Who imagined the sun and gives source to its light

Yet conceals it to bring us the coolness of night

None can fathom



Ending:

Incomparable, unchangeable

You see the depths of my heart and You love me the same

You are amazing God

You are amazing God
