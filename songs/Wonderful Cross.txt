Wonderful Cross

Chris Tomlin

Key: D



Verse 1:

D                 Dsus     D    

When I survey the wondrous cross

D            Dsus      D     D2  

On which the prince of glory died

D                 Dsus      D   

My richest gain I count but loss

D           D2              D     

And pour contempt on all my pride.



Verse 2:

See from his head, His hands, His feet

Sorrow and love flow mingled down

Did eâ€™er such love and sorrow meet

Or thorns compose so rich a crown



Chorus:

      G         D    

O the wonderful cross

      G         D    

O the wonderful cross

        G           

Bids me come and die

    D               A         

and find that I may truly live

O the wonderful cross

O the wonderful cross

All who gather here

By grace draw near and bless your name



Verse 3:

Were the whole realm of nature mine

That were an offering far too small

Love so amazing so divine

Demands my soul, my life, my all
