Meant to Live

Switchfoot

Key: D



Intro:  

Bm  A  Em  G - A

               



Verse 1: 

G                          

Fumbling his confidence and

wondering why the world has passed him by 

G                                   

Hoping that he's meant for more than

arguments and failed attempts to fly 



Chorus:

G                A                Bm  

We were meant to live for so much more

        Em       F#    

Have we lost ourselves?

G                   Em    G                   Em  D

Somewhere we live inside, somewhere we live inside



Verse 2:

Dreaming about providence and 

Whether mice or men have second tries 

Maybe we've been living with our eyes half open 

Maybe we're bent and broken 



Bridge:

D                                     G    

We want more than this world's got to offer

        D                             G    

We want more than this world's got to offer

        D                         G/F#   

We want more than the wars of our fathers

                 C                       G   

And everything inside screams for second life

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 



D                                 G                            

We were meant to live for so much more, have we lost ourselves?

D                                 G                            

We were meant to live for so much more, have we lost ourselves?

D                      G                    

We were meant to live, we were meant to live



Bm  A  Em
