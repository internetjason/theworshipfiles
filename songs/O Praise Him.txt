O Praise Him

Key: G



Verse 1:

G                D/F#                C2          

Turn your ear to heaven and hear the noise inside

    G                         G/F#                  

The sound of angels' awe, the sound of angels' songs

C2                   Am7                     C2                    

All this for a king, we could join and sing, all to Christ the King



Pre-Chorus:

D                C2       D                C2        

How constant, how divine, this song of ours will rise

D                   C2       D                C2                   

O, how constant, how divine, this love of ours will rise, will rise



Chorus:

G             D/F#          Em7         C2      Am7

O Praise Him, O praise Him, He is Holy, He is Holy



Verse 2:

Turn your gaze to heaven and raise a joyous noise 

The sound of salvation come, the sound of rescued ones 

All this for a king, angels join to sing, all for Christ our King 



Pre-Chorus 2:

How infinite and sweet, this love so rescuing 

O, how infinitely sweet, this great love that has redeemed 

as one we sing 



Refrain:

Allelulia, Allelulia, He is Holy, He is Holy
