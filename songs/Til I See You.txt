The greatest love that anyone could ever know

         A                  B                C#m 

That overcame the cross and grave to find my soul

           A               B   

And 'til I see You face to face

          C#m                  

And grace amazing takes me home

I'll trust in You

I will live to bring You praise

       A      B               C#m  B

I will live a child in awe of You
