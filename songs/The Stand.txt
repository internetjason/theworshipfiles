Verse 1:

G                        

You stood before creation

C                    

eternity in Your hand

G                        Em    

You spoke the earth into motion

           C        

My soul now to stand



You stood before my failure

And carried the cross for my shame

My sin weighed upon Your shoulders

My soul now to stand



Pre-Chorus:

              C   Am

So what can I say 

                 Em   G

And what could I do   

               C           D

But offer this heart O God 

          Em     

Completely to You



Verse 2:

So I'll walk upon salvation

Your Spirit alive in me

This life to declare Your promise

My soul now to stand



Chorus:

C       G    

So I'll stand

     D             Em             

With arms high and heart abandoned

In awe of the One who gave it all

I'll stand

My soul Lord to You surrendered

All I am is Yours
