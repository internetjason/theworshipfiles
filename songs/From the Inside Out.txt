           G                            D        A   

A thousand times Iâ€™ve failed still your mercy remains

And should I stumble again I'm caught in your grace

Your will above all else

My purpose remains

The art of losing myself

In bringing You praise

G                  D   

In my heart and my soul

                   Bm  

Lord I give You control

                    A         

Consume me from the inside out

G                    Bm    

Lord let justice and praise

              A  

Become my embrace

                     Em        

To love You from the inside out

     Bm           G                     D        A    

Everlasting, your light will shine when all else fades

Never ending, your glory goes beyond all fame

        D         G           A         Bm    

And the cry of my heart is to bring you praise

         G      A            G          A  

From the inside out, Lord my soul cries out
