Verse:

Great is the Lord

So worthy of praise

Great is the Lord



One generation will commend Your kingdom

To one another, they will speak of You

And I will meditate on Your wonder

And they, they will speak

Of Your glorious splendor

Of Your majesty, everyday I'll praise Thee

Forever and ever



Everyday I will praise

Everyday I will praise

For You open Your hand

And satisfy desires of all things

My God, the King



Pre-Chorus:

The Lord is gracious

And slow to anger

He is rich in love

He is good to all

The Lord is gracious

And slow to anger

He is rich in love

He is good to all



Who call on Him

In truth He is near to them

He is hears their cry

And saves them, He saves them!



Chorus:

The Lord is gracious

And slow to anger

He is rich in love

He is good to all

The Lord is gracious

And slow to anger

He is rich in love

He is good to all



Every day I will praise 

Every day I will praise

For You open Your hand

And satisfy desires of all things

For You open Your hand

And satisfy desires of all things

My God, the King



Lord, You are gracious

You are slow to anger

Abounding in love

You are good to us
