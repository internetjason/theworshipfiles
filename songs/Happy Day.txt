Verse 1:

C                           

The greatest day in history,

F                                    

Death is beaten, you have rescued me,

Am                    F     

Sing it out, Jesus is alive!

C                                

The empty cross, the empty grave,

F                                  

Life eternal, you have won the day,

Am                     F     

Shout it out, Jesus is alive!

G          

He's alive!





Chorus:

C         F          Am  

Oh, happy day, happy day,

    G                 

You washed my sin away

C         F          Am  

Oh, happy day, happy day,

     G                

I'll never be the same

C  F  Am  G                   

          Forever I am changed





Verse 2:

When I stand in that place, 

Free at last, meeting face to face,

I am yours, Jesus you are mine.

Endless joy, perfect peace,

Earthly pain finally will cease

Celebrate, Jesus is alive,

He's alive!



Bridge:

Am                  Em 

Oh, what a glorious day

                F  

What a glorious way

     C                 

That you have saved me!

Am                  Em 

Oh, what a glorious day

F               C   

What a glorious name
