Verse 1:

     C             

Give me eyes to see

G               D  

More of who You are

         C       

May what I behold

G                D    

Still my anxious heart

          C           

Take what I have known

    G            D    

And break it all apart

             C               D    

Cause You my God are greater still



Chorus:

   C      G    

No sky contains

   D        Em     

No doubt re-strains

        C  

All You are

    G                D  

The greatness of our God

           C       G   

I spend my life to know

    D/F#         Em   

And I'm far from close

           C  

To all You are

    G                D  

The greatness of our God



Verse 2:

Give me grace to see 

Beyond this moment here 

To believe that there 

Is nothing left to fear  

That You alone are high above it all 

You my God are greater still 



Brigde:

             C      

And there is nothing

         G         D     

That can ever separate us

         C               G    

There is nothing that can ever

     D                Em  

Separate if from Your love

   C        G         D/F#         Em    

No life, no death, of this I am convinced

       C               D    

You my God are greater still



Chorus 2:

And no words can say

Nor song convey all You are

The greatness of our God

I spend my life to know

And I'm far from close to all You are

The greatness of our God
