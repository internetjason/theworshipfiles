Verse 1:

Em                            D             Em   D

Christmas trees up seems this world spirals down 

Em                    D       Em   

Children are sleeping all over town

G            D       Em               

I found some time to think about a day

     Em                     D       Em 

That right now doesn’t seem so far away



Chorus 1:

G  C      D                  G   

Oh what a night it must have been

     G           C       D           G  

Young couple and babe no room at the inn

G             C      D         G  

Couldn’t they help a mother to be?

      Em           D              G                

Their actions were proof that the world was in need

    G       D          G   

The day our savior was born

    G       D          Em  

The day our savior was born



Verse 2:

Something has filled up the air that I breathe

And right now I’m almost able to see

The stable that was no place for a king

The shepherds as they tremble while angels they sing



Chorus 2:

Glory to God in highest

And on earth peace among men

With whom he is pleased

Oh what a sight that the shepherds did see

The day our savior was born

The day our savior was born



Instrumental:

Verse 3:

I try to picture but can’t comprehend

Battles that were fought but not among men 

As God perfect plan came to world as a man

He crushed all the hopes that the enemy had



Chorus 3:

G      C           D             G   

Silent night no it couldn’t have been

       G           C         D          G  

'Cause Angels were screaming victory is His

Em          D                   G                  

Demons they groaned cause their plans had been torn

G               C              D        G    

So lift up your voice with the heavenly hosts

    G       D          G   

The day our savior was born
