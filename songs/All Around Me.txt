All Around Me

Flyleaf

Key: G



Em  G  C

       



Verse 1:

My hands are searching for you

My arms are outstretched towards you

I feel you on my fingertips

My tongue dances behind my lips for you



This fire rising through my being

Burning I'm not used to seeing you



Pre-Chorus:

G/B C   G/B C       

I'm alive, I'm alive



Chorus:

I can feel you all around me

Thickening the air I'm breathing

Holding on to what I'm feeling

Savoring this heart that's healing



Verse 2:

My hands float up above me

And you whisper you love me

And I begin to fade

Into our secret place



The music makes me sway

The angels singing say we are alone with you

I am alone and they are too with you



Bridge:

Take my hand

I give it to you

Now you own me

All I am

You said you would never leave me

I believe you

I believe



Ending:

I can feel you all around me

Thickening the air I'm breathing

Holding on to what I'm feeling

Savoring this heart that's healed
