Verse 1:

G                                   

If blood is running through my veins

If I've been given another day

Em                   

If I can open my eyes

There's gotta be a reason why 



G                            

In the morning when I wake up

If there's air filling up my lungs

Em                

If I'm still alive

There's gotta be a reason why



Pre-Chorus:

    Em  D                    C     

And oh, if my heart's still beating

It's only so I can



Chorus:

G  Am            Em 

Love the Lord my God

            D    

With all my heart

G  Am         Em 

Love, love anyone

          D   

With open arms

C                   G         

I want to live with no regrets

     D               Em  D

When all is said and done

C            G                   D     

If I'm still breathing there's a reason

                   G   

It's only so I can love



Verse 2:

I wasn't made just to take up space

I want to give my life away

Gonna leave a mark

Be a light in the dark



Grace is gonna be what I'm about

Where people lay their burdens down

There's only so much time

Before I leave this world behind



Bridge:

Am              Em      D 

Love because he rescued me

Laid down his life

Am         Em          D 

Because he first loved me

It's the reason why
