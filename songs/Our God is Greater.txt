Verse 1:

G#m       E           B   

Water You turned into wine

G#m        E           B    

Opened the eyes of the blind

               C#m7    

There's no one like You

          F# 

None like You

Into the darkness You shine

Out of the ashes we rise

There's no one like You

None like You

G#m                 E                  

Our God is greater, our God is stronger

God You are higher than any other

G#m                E               

Our God is healer, awesome in power

Our God, our God



Verse 2:

Into the darkness You shine

Out of the ashes we rise 

There's no one like You

None like You

Bridge:

G#m                     

And if our God is for us

E                          

Then who could ever stop us

B                        

And if our God is with us

F#/A#                        

Then what could stand against

Our God is greater, our God is stronger

B                       F#/A#    

God You are higher than any other

G#m                E               

Our God is healer, awesome in power

     B       F# 

Our God, our God
