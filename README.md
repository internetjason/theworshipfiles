song-list.php scans the .txt files in the subfolder "songs/" (not in the repo) and outputs the list of all songs as titles.
song.php grabs the contents of the .txt file and inserts it into a nicely formatted textarea. 

Note that I did not write the php as functions since I'm really only dealing with these two pages. 
It's not the cleanest code I've ever written :)
